&lt;p&gt;Recently, I made this blog using Pelican and a number of other tools. I want to share the process as simple as possible. The blog is hosted in Github as Github Pages.This first post mainly focused on how I made this blog possible. I have been a member in Github for long time and I never took it as serious as I am now. I was aware of github pages as well. I thought the main aim of github pages is to host your documentation kind of stuff, I never expected you can build whole new blog just like blogger or even better control over it. So I read one post from dataquest last week, then I releazed the power of github pages and how people are sharing their ideas with ease. Officially github is focusing on Jekyll static generator, but I found out that Pelican is the one I need because it makes easy to share jupyter notebooks. I have been Googling all the time and reading number of blogs and help links and so many other stuff over the course of making the blog. SO I thought it would be better if somebody want to build one and they can refer a single place.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Vipin G S</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.vipings.com,2017-11-06:/blog/2017/11/06/blogging-pelican-jupyter/</guid><category>Python</category><category>Blogging</category><category>JupyterNotebook</category><category>Pelican</category></item></channel></rss>

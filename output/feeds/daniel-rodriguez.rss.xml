that allows to do real-time computation that its been in the big data news
lately and I was curious to try it to see if its really good or is a just
the new map-reduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first (and no brainer) ideas I had was to do real-time
classification of a scikit-learn model, the main issue was that storm is Java and
I didn't want to all the integration between Java and Python
but after I saw in the pydata videos that the people at
&lt;a href="https://parsely.com/"&gt;Parsely&lt;/a&gt; already took some of that pain out with
their new &lt;a href="https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse"&gt;streamparse&lt;/a&gt; library
I had no more excuses to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Storm cluster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to deploy a storm cluster and after failing to use their EC2 scripts
I decided to do it myself using &lt;a href="http://saltstack.com"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;.
I found an amazing &lt;a href="http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-multi-node-storm-cluster"&gt;step by step tutorial&lt;/a&gt;
from  Michael Noll that explains how to deploy everything, including the
a the zookeeper quorum (a first time from me too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is important to note that Michael Noll has some nice scripts to deploy everything
using puppet and vagrant, but since I don't like puppet I decided to recreate some
of his work on salt which it was very straight forward since there are already some
&lt;a href="https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/zookeeper-formula"&gt;zookeeper states&lt;/a&gt; for salt
so I only had to leverage that to create some storm states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states I created are very extensible and can extended to many instances
using salt-cloud as described in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having the storm cluster up and running I needed to solve a different
issue: most storm topologies examples do a very simple calculation,
e.g. word count, they don't need to load anything (big) to do their calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scikit-learn classification is a little bit more complex since it needs to
load the model before doing the calculation and you don't want to load the model
in every storm process in the same machine.
Thats where &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#model-persistence"&gt;memory mapping and joblib&lt;/a&gt;
comes handy, you can load the model once into memory once
and other processes can use the same model into memory to do the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy the pickled model into the storm cluster I used salt again to
just download the model from github.
The example I did uses a tiny SVM on the iris dataset
but the idea can be easily extended to download bigger models from S3 for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;streamparse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse"&gt;streamparse&lt;/a&gt; is a nice library
from the people at &lt;a href="https://parsely.com/"&gt;Parsely&lt;/a&gt; that makes easy to create
storm topologies using python and a little bit of clojure.
The library is young but it looks promising, my main complain is that it
tries to take care of more that it should: python environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They try to solve the virutalenvs problem using fabric and the classic virtualenv,
a valid approach for a small storm cluster and basic python libraries.
I believe that this problem should be solve by a tool like salt in case you
have a big cluster and also using &lt;a href="http://continuum.io/downloads"&gt;conda&lt;/a&gt;
for the python environmenst since it gives you an easier use of the
to use the scientific libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I used salt to solve the virutalenv problems using one of my
&lt;a href="http://danielfrg.com/blog/2014/04/18/ipython-parallel-cluster-salt/"&gt;conda states&lt;/a&gt;
and then I had to recreate some of the streamparse submit so it does not create
any virutalenvs, just submit the topology to the storm-nimbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Storm topology logs" src="/images/blog/2014/08/storm-log.png" title="Storm topology logs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with the results since I was able to do this by
leveraging a lot of useful tools making it very easy to develop and deploy,
making it very scalable and reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need to test more storm to take my final decision and see
were it is really useful. Is the complexity of maintaining a zookeeper quorum
and storm cluster really worth it? Or do I just keep using 0MQ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bonus idea is to make the storm spouts and bolts more useful
by integrating with the outside world, for now it just keeps predicting the
same data forever, maybe a good idea would be to do some websockets as spout
and bolts to make a nice real-time UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the code and documentation on how to make everything is on github:
